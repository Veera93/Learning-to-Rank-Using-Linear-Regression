# Learning-to-Rank-Using-Linear-Regression

This project aims at solving the Learning to Rank (LeToR) problem such that we take a categorical target variable (t=[0,1,2]) and map our input vector x, features used to decipher the ranking, to a real valued scalar target y(x,w) using linear regression.  For the given two datasets, one real data (LeTOR) and one synthetic data, prediction of  the weights, error (cost function), using both a closed form solution and stochastic gradient descent were performed
